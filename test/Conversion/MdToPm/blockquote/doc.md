Exploring the concept of work and its relation to play.

> The next form of society will not be based on industrial production. It will be a society of realized art. (Situationist International, [_The Bad Days will End_](https://libcom.org/article/bad-days-will-end-0 "The Bad Days will End, Internationale Situationniste #7")[, Internationale Situationniste #7](https://libcom.org/article/bad-days-will-end-0 "The Bad Days will End, Internationale Situationniste #7"))

> Labor, perhaps even more than technics, must recover its own **creative voice**. Its abstract form, its de­ployment in the framework of linear time as a res temporalis, its cruel objectification as mere, homogeneous energy, must yield to the con­creteness of skill, to the festiveness of communal activity, to a recogni­tion of its own subjectivity.

## Work and Rhythm

> Marx's ideal workday, when I am able \"to hunt in the morning, fish in the afternoon, rear cattle in the evening, criticise after dinner, just as I have a mind, without ever becoming hunter, fisherman, shepherd or critic\" (Marx and Engels 1845/46, 53), points to a crucial characteristic of work from a eudemonistic perspective: if a change of work is a holiday, then what makes work an especially painful activity is its continuation through an over-extended period of time \[...\].

> The repetition of the same, even innocuous per se, becomes a torment, as in the \"Chinese water torture\" where the pain comes from a steady dripping of water droplets on the same part of the body. And the classical image of the Fordist worker, chained to the assembly line so that he/she must repeat the same motion relentlessly, resembles that of the galley slave who does nothing but work the oars. Relentless repetition of the same is what Thanatos (the death impulse identified by Freud) is about. Relentlessness and endlessness are the two things that make hell hellish \[...\]

> All in all, man is living through and craving for variety, alternation and diversity. Just as we alternate inhaling and exhaling, chewing and swallowing, sleeping and waking, we need to alternate our activities. Post-Fordist human resources specialists of Internet work, who have understood this, would allow private Internet surfing (cyberloafing) to employees while at their workstation to increase productivity by lowering stress. This raises the issue of rhythm. Autonomous work (when I choose to work) is set to individual bio-rhythms, heteronomous work (when I have work imposed on me from outside, whether by necessity or violence) is set to extraneous rhythms: slaves on a galley pulling on the oars to the drum's rhythm, marching soldiers, workers on the assembly-line, Internet slaves desperately trying to catch up with incoming emails are all subject to a form of torture. In moderate doses, the extraneous rhythm energizes, as when dancing to a tune, while it becomes painful and even lethal in excessive doses, as any stimulus.
